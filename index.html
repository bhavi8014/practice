                    <h1>LORENZO ST JOHN</h1>
                    <p>Lorenzo "Enzo" St. John was a main character, minor antagonist, and anti-hero in The Vampire Diaries. He was formerly a
                    major recurring character in the fifth season of the series, before being promoted to main in the sixth season. He was a
                    vampire who was previously Damon Salvatore's cellmate in the 1950s, after being captured by the Augustines. He was first
                    mentioned by Dr. Wes Maxfield, being dubbed as the "Augustine Vampire".In the fifth season during Man on Fire, Enzo and Stefan fought intensely with one another. Enzo attempted to set Stefan
                    on fire, but Stefan pushed his hand inside of Enzo, grabbing his heart. Stefan refused to kill Enzo, but Enzo stepped
                    back and his heart was extracted. Enzo told Stefan that his revenge was making Stefan explain to Damon how he killed his
                    best friend. Enzo later passed through Bonnie to the Other Side. While on the Other Side, Enzo realizes that since Markos has entered the world of the living, that the dimension is
                    falling apart. He tried his best to figure out how to get out of the Other Side and put his trust in Bonnie. In Home,
                    Markos was sucked into Hell and Enzo successfully passed through Bonnie, returning to life. In the sixth season, Enzo began a mission to save Damon and Bonnie from the prison world they were trapped in with the
                    help of Caroline Forbes. He flirted with Caroline and antagonized Stefan for abandoning his search for Damon. After
                    Damon's return, Enzo developed a jealousy towards Stefan and vows to make his life miserable. He forced Matt Donovan to
                    assist him in doing so but later changed his mind when he began to care about protecting Stefan's niece, Sarah Nelson.
                    He later encountered Lily, the woman who turned him into a vampire and who also happens to be Damon and Stefan's mother.</p>
